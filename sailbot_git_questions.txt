# UBC Sailbot Software Technical Quiz: Version Control

1. To clone the `ubcsailbot` repository onto my computer, I would run:

```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.ubcsailbot.git
```

2. To add `wind_angles.inc` and then commit and push the changes, I would run:

```
$ git add wind_angles.inc
$ git commit -m "Tuned wind angles and added unit tests."
$ git push origin <branch>
```

Assumptions:
* I have already set up the remote repository 
* I am already on the branch that I would like to commit and push
